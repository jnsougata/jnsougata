🐛 **You’ve reached my side of the web**  
I'm a physicist-turned-programmer who talks to both qubits and cbits.  
I build stuff to solve my own problems, and sometimes for the bros too.  
Most of it starts as a mess, but ends up working with hacky brilliance.

🧠 **Interests**  
> Quantum Chaos: Because pseudo-random is for simulations. I want the real weird.<br>
> Probabilistic Systems: Nothing screams "confidence" like a model that only probably works.<br>
> Real AI (not the LLM hype): If it can't learn and forget, is it even intelligent, bro?<br>
> Knowledge Graphs: Graphs that even machines can understand. Sometimes..<br>
